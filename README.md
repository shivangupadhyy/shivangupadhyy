### 🚀 About Me

I'm just getting started with my MCA journey this year — and with it, a commitment to becoming a **Software Engineer** who can build real-world AI-powered web applications, write clean code, and solve challenging problems with logic and creativity.

I come from a self-taught background where I’ve already explored:
- 💻 Basic Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- 🧪 Built and broken a few mini projects along the way

Now I’m leveling up... step-by-step.

### 🎯 My Current Goals (2025–2027)

✅ Master Full Stack Web Development (React + Node.js + Next.js)  
✅ Learn AI agent development using OpenAI, LangChain, and vector databases  
✅ Practice DSA daily with Java to crack product-based interviews  
✅ Build real projects and contribute on GitHub  
✅ Land a strong off-campus remote internship/job by 2026–27

### 💡 My Learning Philosophy

“You don’t need to be great to start.  
But you need to start to be great.”

So here I am — starting publicly. Learning in front of the world.
